    <h3>Efficient anomaly detection in network traffic with Yara rules and machine learning techniques</h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Debabrata Swain (Computer Science and Eng. Dept) </h5> 
    <p class="small">Implementing Yara rules on the Network that can find real-time Malware or any other malicious activities that can 
be done on the Network.</p>
<p class="small">Comparing MACHINE LEARNING techniques, YARA RULES, and Traditional ways to find malicious activity and 
showing which one should be useful in a particular scenario.</p>
  </div>
   <div class="card">
    <h3>Leveraging various techniques of machine learning and deep learning for fake speech detection </h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Nishant Doshi (Computer Science and Eng. Dept) </h5> 
    <p class="small">Conducted comparative analysis of ML and DL models (SVM, RF, XGBoost, CNN, LSTM, CNN-BiLSTM) for fake speech detection using key performance evaluation metrics.</p>
<p class="small">Developed a hybrid CNN + BiLSTM architecture achieving 92.3% accuracy, outperforming traditional machine learning models.</p>
 <p class="small"> that advanced deep learning techniques significantly improve reliability and robustness in deepfake audio detection systems.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Enhancing the Security of IoT Wireless Sensors with Strong Three-factor User Authentication</h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Nishant Doshi (Computer Science and Eng. Dept)  </h5> 
    <p class="small">In this Project, I reviewed more than 10 authentication schemes, and found there is any vulnerabilities that can be 
exploit in the IoT system.</p>
<p class="small">Finding the vulnerabilities, I compared them with existing schemes and provided a thorough analysis on how my 
scheme is better than the previous one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Image Privacy Protection </h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Manish Paliwal (Computer Science and Eng. Dept)  </h5> 
    <p class="small">The proposed application aims to enhance privacy and consent in social media photo sharing by preventing the 
unauthorized dissemination of individuals’ images. </p>
<p class="small">It includes Enhanced Privacy, Respect for Consent, Prevention of Unintentional Sharing of image and Compliance 
with Privacy Regulations.</p>
<p class="small">As in output, there is an API that can add on social media and prevent the unintentional sharing of images. And As 
an Machine Learning algorithm, I used total five algorithm but ResnetV1 provides best accuracy in recognition 97%.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>A Detailed Exploration to the Cloud Forensics Challenges and Solutions </h3>
    
    <p class="small">This contains review about cloud forensic challenges, Tools and techniques. Also, gives brief introduction about 
one of the best cloud forensic model FROST.  </p>
<p class="small">For the FROST, I analyzed 5 papers that previously worked on the FROST and found that there is some difficulty to 
implement. So, gives optimal solution for implementing in cloud.</p>

    <h3>An Optimal Clustering Approach For Milk Dairy Networking </h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Manish Paliwal and Dr. Aditya Shastri (Computer Science and Eng. Dept)  </h5> 
    <p class="small">For this project, I gathered the one-day data for milk transportation with various locations and found the important 
data from the file.  </p>
<p class="small">Implement the various algorithms, from which K-means and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms provide higher 
accuracy for the finding route for the tanker. </p>
<p class="small">After clustering, implement a traveling salesman for all the possible routes in the cluster and also use the most 
optimal path for transportation.</p>
  </div>
<div class="card">
    <h3>Medical Domain Data Security using Encryption & Steganography  </h3>
    <h5>Guide: Dr. Manish Paliwal (Computer Science and Eng. Dept)  </h5> 
    <p class="small">For the image steganography, the dataset image was taken from Kaggle, and for the hide the data we made txt 
files for hiding in the images.  </p>
<p class="small">As an outcome, we made an application that is used to hide the encrypted data in the image using the image 
steganography method. To achieve steganography, we use the LPS technique and use AES to achieve data 
encryption.  </p>
<p class="small">After clustering, implement a traveling salesman for all the possible routes in the cluster and also use the most 
optimal path for transportation.</p>
